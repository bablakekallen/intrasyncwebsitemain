========================================
BLOG FILES UPLOAD - FIXED VERSION
(For Existing blog/ Folder)
========================================

ZIP FILE: blog-files-only-20251206.zip
SIZE: 646 KB
CONTAINS: 91 HTML files (NO folder wrapper)

========================================
IMPORTANT - THIS IS DIFFERENT:
========================================

This zip contains ONLY the .html files
WITHOUT a "blog/" folder wrapper.

This means when you extract, the files will go
directly into whatever folder you're in.

========================================
UPLOAD STEPS:
========================================

1. LOG INTO CPANEL
   - Open File Manager

2. NAVIGATE INTO YOUR EXISTING BLOG FOLDER
   - Go to: public_html/
   - OPEN the "blog" folder (double-click it)
   - You should now be INSIDE: public_html/blog/

3. UPLOAD THE ZIP FILE HERE
   - While inside public_html/blog/
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Select: blog-files-only-20251206.zip
   - Wait for upload to complete

4. EXTRACT THE ZIP FILE
   - Right-click on blog-files-only-20251206.zip
   - Select "Extract"
   - Choose "Extract to current directory"
   - Click "Extract File(s)"

   ✅ This will place all 91 HTML files directly in public_html/blog/
   ✅ It will REPLACE any old versions
   ✅ NO nested blog/blog/ structure!

5. SET PERMISSIONS (Important!)
   - Select ALL the .html files that were just extracted
   - Right-click → "Change Permissions"
   - Set to: 644
     (Or check: Owner: Read+Write, Group: Read, Public: Read)
   - Click "Change Permissions"

6. CLEAN UP
   - Delete blog-files-only-20251206.zip
   - You're done!

========================================
VERIFY IT WORKED:
========================================

Your structure should look like:
public_html/
  └── blog/
      ├── ai-transforming-precast-production.html
      ├── capacity-planning-precast-plant.html
      ├── (89 more .html files...)
      └── _template.html

NOT like this (wrong):
public_html/
  └── blog/
      └── blog/  ← WRONG! No nested folder
          └── *.html

Visit: https://intrasyncindustrial.com/blog/ai-transforming-precast-production.html

Should see:
✓ Blog post loads (no 403 error)
✓ Author box with "Written by IntraSync Engineering Team"
✓ "Reviewed by Zachary Frye, CTO & Founder"

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================================

If you still get 403:
1. Check file permissions = 644
2. Check blog folder permission = 755
3. Make sure you're accessing the right path

If files are in wrong location:
- Look for: public_html/blog/blog/ (nested)
- If you see this, MOVE all .html files up one level
- Delete the nested "blog" folder
