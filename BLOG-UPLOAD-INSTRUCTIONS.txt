If blog posts don't show up:
1. Verify the "blog/" folder exists in your public_html/
2. Check that files are inside: public_html/blog/*.html
3. Check file permissions (should be 644 for .html files)
4. Clear your browser cache
5. Try accessing directly: yoursite.com/blog/ai-transforming-precast-production.html

If you get 404 errors:
- Make sure blog.html exists in your root (not just in the blog folder)
